      <h3 class="sub-headline">Here’s a collection of The Hindu’s coverage on the literary giant </h3>
      <p class="author">The Hindu Bureau</p>
      <p class="text">M.T. Vasudevan Nair, one of India’s greatest writers of all time, died in Kozhikode, Kerala, at a private hospital on December 25, 2024. He was 91.</p>
      <p class="text">Popularly known as M.T., he was born at a village named Kudallur, near Ponnani, and made a mark as a writer of remarkable skills from an early age. He was just 29 when he wrote Asuravithu, which has been hailed by some, including critic M. Leelavathi, as the best novel in Malayalam.</p>
      <p class="text">He became a much-in-demand scriptwriter and penned classics such as Oru Vadakkan Veeragatha, Amrutham Gamaya, Panchagni, Parinayam, Aksharangal, Aalkoottathil Thaniye and Thazhvaram. His last major theatrical release was Pazhassi Raja, in 2013.</p>
