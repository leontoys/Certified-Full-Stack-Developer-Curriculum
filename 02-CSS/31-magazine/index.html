      <h2>P. Jayachandran (1944-2025): Soulful voice of Indian playback music, passes away </h2>
      <p>Renowned playback singer P. Jayachandran, popular across 
        South India and affectionately called “Bhava Gayakan” 
        for his soulful renditions that beautifully expressed emotions 
        such as love, longing, and devotion, passed away on the evening 
        of January 9 at a private medical college in Thrissur, Kerala. 
        The singer was 80. He had been unwell for quite some time and 
        undergoing treatment, hospital sources said. He was taken to 
        the hospital after collapsing at his residence on 
        January 9. </p>
        <p>Jayachandran recorded over 16,000 songs in Malayalam, Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, and Hindi, was widely recognised for his contribution to Indian music, having won several awards for best playback singer. He was honoured with the National Film Award and the Kerala government’s J.C. Daniel Award for his outstanding contribution to cinema. Additionally, he won Kerala State Film Awards five times and Tamil Nadu State Film Awards twice. His performance of “Shiva Shankara Sharana Sarva Vibho” from the film Sree Narayana Guru earned him the National Award. </p>
        <p>Born on March 3, 1944, in Ernakulam, Jayachandran’s career spanned five decades, during which he worked with legendary composers and directors, and left an indelible mark on the Indian music industry. His musical journey began in high school, playing the mridangam and singing light classical music. </p>
    <p>In the 1958 state school kalotsavam [an annual arts festival hosted by the Kerala government for high school and higher secondary students in Kerala], Jayachandran won first place in the mridangam competition. It was also during this festival that he met K.J. Yesudas, who won first place in classical music that year. </p>
    <p>He collaborated with numerous renowned composers, including G. Devarajan, M.S. Baburaj, V. Dakshinamoorthy, K. Raghavan, M.K. Arjunan, M.S. Viswanathan, Ilaiyaraaja, A.R. Rahman, Vidyasagar, and M. Jayachandran. The singer worked closely with composer Ilaiyaraaja, contributing to several hit Tamil songs, including “Rasathi unna kanatha nenju” from Vaidehi Kathirundal. </p>

      <h2>M.T. Vasudevan Nair (1933-2024): Kerala’s literary lodestar </h2>
      <p>He was officially M.T. Vasudevan Nair, but peers close to him and friends of the same or older generation called him Vasu; others generally used his initials “MT”. He chose the last for me when, in the 1980s, I wrote to him from Delhi to ask how I should address him. “MT”, he replied, would be fine. </p>
      <p>You did not so much write to, or meet with, MT as commune with him, if he let you. You did not even need to meet to keep the connect continuous and going. As far back as I can remember, this has been so. He would reach out, occasionally, as if from a seamless past, with a request that had the assurance of an order: to participate in the literary event he convened each February at Thunchan Parambu in Tirur where Thunchath Ezhuthachan, the paterfamilias of the Malayalam language, was born. You went because it was an opportunity to comply; to reaffirm your bona fides to yourself.</p>

      <h2>The more things change, the more some things must stay the same </h2>
      <p>Worldwide, professional journalism and the news industry are struggling to defend and, where possible, to reassert their relevance and value under profoundly changed and changing circumstances. Media transformation in this digital age is being powered and continuously challenged by new and rapidly developing technologies, platforms, and tools. The technology companies with their tremendous search, social networking, and messaging firepower have been engaged in a seemingly irreversible process of hegemonising the media ecosystem. With the accompanying changes in audience behaviour and news consumption, especially among the young, the big challenge for the news media industry and professional journalism is engagement of the audience that is getting away. Related to this, the revenue and business model that served the news media industry so well in the second half of the 20th century has come under intense and often overwhelming pressure, where it has not collapsed.</p>
